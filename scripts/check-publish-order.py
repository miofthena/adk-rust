"""CI check: a valid publish order must exist for all publishable crates.

The publish order itself is computed at runtime by `cargo xtask publish`
(from cargo metadata), so there is no hand-maintained tier list to validate.
What can still go wrong — and what this guards — is the graph itself:

  1. A dependency cycle among publishable crates (normal/build deps).
  2. A *versioned* dev-dependency cycle: `cargo publish` resolves dev-deps
     with version requirements when generating the package lockfile, so a
     versioned dev-dep pointing at a crate that can only be published later
     deadlocks a sequential publish (this broke the v1.0.0 release).
     Path-only dev-deps are stripped at publish and are exempt — keep
     internal dev-deps path-only.
